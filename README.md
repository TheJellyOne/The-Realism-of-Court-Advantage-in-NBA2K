# The-Realism-of-Court-Advantage-in-NBA2K

## Introduction
This was a brief project I completed shortly after taking the Google Data Analytics online course. Mainly intended as a refresher course to get back into mental shape, I learned a lot more than I thought I would (or maybe I just forgot everything I learned in the first place). 

I created a report using Rmarkdown and created a *html* file that should be easy to download and read. The lack of change in free throw percentage isn't some groundbreaking discovery, but this did give me a lot of needed practice in R. I'll be working on a more detailed case study next.
