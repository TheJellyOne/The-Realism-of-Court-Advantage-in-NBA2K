# The-Realism-of-Court-Advantage-in-NBA2K

###Introduction
This was a brief project I completed shortly after taking the Google Data Analytics online course. Mainly intended as a refresher course to get back into mental shape, I learned a lot more than I thought I would (or maybe I just forgot everything I learned in the first place). 

I created a report using Rmarkdown and created a *html* file that should be easy to understand and read. To view it, just download the html file and open it in any web browser. The lack of change in free throw percentage isn't some groundbreaking discovery, but this did give me a lot of needed practice in R.
